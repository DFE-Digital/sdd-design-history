## Manage an academy transfer

The mascot for Manage an academy conversion is a camel. We chose a camel because it reflects our core team. Camels are adaptive creatures, they are strong and compassionate (and very attractive). The camel also symbolises the nature of our service, a vehicle to help lighten heavy loads.
