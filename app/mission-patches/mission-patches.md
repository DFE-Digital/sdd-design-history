## Manage an academy conversion
The mascot for Manage an academy conversion is a camel. We chose a camel because it reflects our core team. Camels are adaptive creatures, they are strong and compassionate (and very attractive). The camel also symbolises the nature of our service, a vehicle to help lighten heavy loads.



This patch celebrates our pre-Advisory Board system entering into private beta. The camelâ€™s blanket represents the work that has been done so far, the bird symbolises the users we are taking on the journey with us.
