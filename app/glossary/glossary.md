## A

Academy
: a publicly funded independent school. They operate outside the local authority control. Academies receive funding directly from the government and are run by an academy trust. A local authority school can convert to become an academy school.

Academy transfer
: when an academy moves from their exisiting trust to a new trust. There are different types of transfers:
- voluntary transfer is when the academy chooses to transfer
- intervention transfer is when an academy is forced to transfer usually because it's not performing well under the current trust.

Academy trust (AT)
: a charitable trust that establishes and operates academies and free schools

Academy order (AO)
: a document that the Department for Education (DfE) gives to a school to signify that the DfE is content, in principle, for the school to convert to an academy.

Articles of association
: this document sets out the charitable purpose of the trust and its governance structure. This includes information about:

- what the trust exists to do
- appointing and removing trust members
- establishing committees and local governing bodies
The articles also provide a framework for trusts to act within company and charity law.

Converter
: one of three ways a school can become an academy. Higher performing schools can apply using the Apply to become an academy service.

Converter academy
: once a local authority maintained school has converted to an academy, it is known as an 'converter academy'.

## D

Data and reporting tool (DaRT)
: a system that the academy and maintained schools directorate (AMSD) caseworkers use to manage academy schools and trusts. They will record any concerns like financial or governance concerns on this system. It is due to be decommissioned soon.

Delivery officer (DO)
: the main users for the academy conversion and academy transfer internal service. They handle the internal applications for schools converting to academies, academies transfering to another trust and academies making changes. They are the lead contact for schools and trusts throughout the conversion process. They can also sometimes be called ‘project leads’ or ‘delivery leads’.

</br>

## E

Establishment
: another word for a school, this includes academies, free schools, university technical colleges (UTCs) and local authority maintained schools.
</br>

## F

Financial deficit
: academies are expected to recover from a financial deficit within 3 years. When a school converts to an academy or transfers to a new trust, the delivery officer needs to check the school does not have a financial deficit. If the financial deficit is too much, the school might not be able to convert.

Free school meals (FSM)
: schools can offer students free school meals and during a conversion or transfer a delivery officer should check the percentage of free school meals that the school offers.

Funding agreement (FA)
: the funding agreement provides the framework for academies or free schools to operate in. Funding agreements can consist of a master funding agreement (MFA) and a supplemental funding agreement (SFA).

- the MFA is for a trust and used in application to form a new multi-academy trust
- the SFA is for each of the schools joining new or exisitng trust

: this is a template the delivery officers need to fill out and take to an HTB meeting. The information they put into these templates is about the school and the trust and why the reason for the conversion. They will also include any risks and issues to the conversion so that the HTB can make the right decision about if the school should become an academy.

Headteacher board papers or documents
: once the HTB template is signed off, the HTB secretariat will prepare HTB papers to go to the HTB meeting. For a conversion, these can include the HTB template, a trust template and an academy order.
</br>

## I

## J

## K

Knowledge and Information Management (KIM)
: the tool currently used for academy management. It will be decomissioned soon.

</br>

## L

Land questionnaire
: this should be filled out by the school or trust’s solicitors during a conversion. It's used to establish how the school’s land is currently managed and how it will transfer from the local authority or owner of the land to the trust. It needs to be completed after the HTB meeting when the conversion has been approved.

Local authority establishment number (LAESTAB)
: seven digit number to refer to an establishment. It also tells you which local authority the establishment is in.

Legal Advisor's Office (LAO)
: this team can give delivery officers advice if they are dealing with a conversion or transfer that has complex legal issues.

Local authority (LA)
: local government administration, when a school converts to an academy the local authority needs to be involved so that things like land and finances can pass to the new trust that is taking on the academy.

Local authority information template (LA proforma)
: this template is sent to the local authority right at the beginning of the conversion process. The LA is expected to fill it out and send it back to the delivery officer. The delivery officer will use the information from the LA to make sure the information provided by the school is correct.

Local authority (LA) maintained school
: maintained schools are those that are funded and controlled by the local education authority
</br>

## M

## O
## P

Published admission number (PAN)

Post academy order (post AO)
: this is the phase of the academy conversion process that comes after the Secretary of State issues a school with an academy order.

Pre and post headteacher board (HTB)
: there are two stages to SDD's academy conversion and transfer services.

- Pre HTB is everything that happens from when the school sends in their application form up until the HTB meeting.
- Post HTB is everything that happens from when the conversion gets approved at HTB up until when the school opens as an academy.
The whole process can take up to 6 months but sometimes longer depending on the complexities.
Pre and post HTB can also be called pre and post AO (academy order).

Private finance initiative (PFI)
: a school or an academy may have a PFI scheme in place which can make the conversion or trnsfer more complicated. A PFI scheme is a way of using private sector finance and expertise to deliver public sector projects. PFI schools can get new buildings and facilities that are maintained by PFI companies. If there is a PFI scheme in place, there will be more paperwork to complete and it is a real pain point for delivery officers.

Project lead (PL)
: project leads handle the internal application for schools converting to academies, academies transfering to another trust and significant change applications. They are the lead contact for schools and trusts throughout the conversion process. They should now be referred to as ‘delivery officers’ or ‘delivery leads’.

## Q
## R

The RSC has the power to make decisions on if conversions, transfers and significant changes can go ahead. They will make these decisions at the HTB meetings. The RSC can also get involved in the conversion or transfer process if there are complicated issues that need to be resolved.

Risk Protection Arrangement (RPA)
: the risk protection arrangement (RPA) is an alternative to commercial insurance for academy trusts. Under RPA, the UK government covers the losses instead of commercial insurance.

Sponsor ID
: a five digit number referring to sponsor, for example SP12345

Single worksheet (SWS)

In a conversion, the land of a school will pass to the trust in different ways depending on what type of school it is.

Viability assessment
: delivery officers have to check if the school applying to convert to an academy is viable. This involves checking the school has been accepting more than 85% of its pupil capacity. The school’s pupil numbers are closely linked to its finances and if there are not enough pupils, this could lead to a financial deficit which is why delivery officers need to check this.
