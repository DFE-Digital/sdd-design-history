AMSD is made up of:
- Academies Operational Delivery Teams
- School resource Management Division (SRM)
- Performance, Operational Policy and Strategy (POPS)
- National Programme and Projects Division (NPPD)

Academies Financial Handbook ( AFH )
: Also known as the Academy Trust Handbook (ATH), academy trusts must comply with this handbook as a condition of their funding agreement.

You can [view it online](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/academy-trust-handbook).

Academy

Academy order ( AO )
: a document that the Department for Education ( DfE ) gives to a school to signify that the DfE is content, in principle, for the school to convert to an academy.

Academy transfer
: when an academy moves from their exisiting trust to a new trust. There are different types of transfers:
- voluntary transfer is when the academy chooses to transfer
- intervention transfer is when an academy is forced to transfer usually because it's not performing well under the current trust.

Academy trust ( AT )
: a charitable trust that establishes and operates academies and free schools

Articles of association
: this document sets out the charitable purpose of the trust and its governance structure. This includes information about:
- what the trust exists to do

The articles also provide a framework for trusts to act within company and charity law.

</br>

## B

Briefing automation tool ( BAT )
: Used by AMSD caseworkers, the BAT shows trust financial and governance information to be used in financial analysis and prevention work.

Budget Forecast Return ( BFR )

Headteacher board template ( HTB template ) (sometimes called project template)
: this is a template the delivery officers need to fill out and take to an HTB meeting. The information they put into these templates is about the school and the trust and why the reason for the conversion.

## L

Land questionnaire
: this should be filled out by the school or trust’s solicitors during a conversion.

Local authority information template ( LA proforma )

Local authority maintained school
: maintained schools are those that are funded and controlled by the local education authority.

</br>

## M

Multi-academy trust ( MAT )

Pre and post headteacher board (HTB)
: there are two stages to SDD's academy conversion and transfer services.
- Pre HTB is everything that happens from when the school sends in their application form up until the HTB meeting.
- Post HTB is everything that happens from when the conversion gets approved at HTB up until when the school opens as an academy.

The whole process can take up to 6 months but sometimes longer depending on the complexities. Pre and post HTB can also be called pre and post AO (academy order).

Private finance initiative ( PFI )
: a school or an academy may have a PFI scheme in place which can make the conversion or trnsfer more complicated. A PFI scheme is a way of using private sector finance and expertise to deliver public sector projects. PFI schools can get new buildings and facilities that are maintained by PFI companies. If there is a PFI scheme in place, there will be more paperwork to complete and it is a real pain point for delivery officers.

Project lead ( PL )
: project leads handle the internal application for schools converting to academies, academies transfering to another trust and significant change applications. They are the lead contact for schools and trusts throughout the conversion process. They should now be referred to as ‘delivery officers’ or ‘delivery leads’.

The school’s pupil numbers are closely linked to its finances and if there are not enough pupils, this could lead to a financial deficit which is why delivery officers need to check this.

Voluntary aided or voluntary controlled school
: schools are clasified into 4 types:
- voluntary aided schools
