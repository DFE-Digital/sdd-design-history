title: Benefits and risks
description: Why we changed a service task name from Benefits and other factors

We learned from delivery officer research that the name [Benefits and other factors](https://academy-transfers-prototype.london.cloudapps.digital/version-4/pre-htb/school-1/benefits-and-other-factors) doesn't resonate with the delivery officers in the Manage an academy transfer service when they complete a project template.

Here is a snippet from one of our user interviews:

“[Delivery officer]: can I click on other factors?”
“[Interviewer]: is that clear to you?”
“[Delivery officer]: no, those things listed would be risks”

## Why we have included this task in the service

### User need
**As a** delivery officer working on Managing an academy transfer
**I need** to understand the timelines agreed for the project delivery
**So that** I can effectively manage the project to meet its deadline

## Pre-private beta user research insights
* The title could be key dates
* It is very hard to remember, the conversation started way back
* I would get rid of the date and keep just the month

## Giving an option for users to declare date unknown

Before

After
![When was the transfer first discussed with a trust](/images/transfers/set-transfer-dates/after.png)

## Expected result

We are confident that the additional option to declare "I do not know this" will help our users to complete this task with ease. We will monitor the usage of this question and update further insights as we reach out to more users.
