title: Benefits and risks
description: Why we changed a service task name from Benefits and other factors

We learned from delivery officer research that the name [Benefits and other factors](https://academy-transfers-prototype.london.cloudapps.digital/version-4/pre-htb/school-1/benefits-and-other-factors) doesn't resonate with the delivery officers in the Manage an academy transfer service when they complete a project template.

Here is a snippet from one of our user research interviews:

>“[Delivery officer]: can I click on other factors?”
>“[Interviewer]: is that clear to you?”
>“[Delivery officer]: no, those things listed would be risks”

The current project template used by delivery officers asks about the benefits and risks of the transfer: other factors are not asked for. To make it easier for delivery officers to understand and complete their project template, we renamed Benefits and other factors to Benefits and risks.

We believe that changing this content to reflect the task a delivery officer needs to complete will give them better confidence when interacting with this section.


## How we ask about risks

To make the questions clearer and relevant to the delivery officer, we made an update to the way we are asking the risks associated with the transfer.

Rather than asking the delivery officer “Are there any other factors to consider during this transfer”, we changed the question to: "**Are there any risks to consider for this transfer?**”. If the delivery officer answers yes to the question, we then ask the delivery officer a follow up question to select the risks associated with the transfer.
