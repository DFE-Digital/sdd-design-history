When designing and building a service, it can be easy to forget why previous decisions were made, even more so as new people join the team and others leave. A design history can help by creating a permanent record.

A design history site is like a blog, with posts describing the development of new features, iterations of existing ones or findings from user research – anything that may be useful to return to later.

### This project was developed for the SDD at the Department for Education to:

* Create a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how lightweight front ends scoping the “changing a school’s trust” journey can have enhanced user experience and productivity whilst been able to manipulate data from the existing TRAMS system.

### Our goal was 

To explore if there are any other technological options that would enable SDD to;

* Better serve our users needs
* Address significant accessibility issues identified with the current approach
* Allow us to adapt our service quickly following user feedback, in a cost effective way


As of January 2021, the [Academy transfers prototype](https://academy-transfers-prototype.london.cloudapps.digital) includes more than 17 different pages exploring how we can allow RDD agents to interact with real dynamics 365 data held in TRAMS.


You can learn more about how and why other  teams created their design history on the [DfE Digital blog](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/01/design-history/).
