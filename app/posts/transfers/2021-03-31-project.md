### The projects overview page

The Academy transfers service shares a lot of cross cutting elements with the Apply to become an Academy service. It is only natural and wise that design elements will be shared across the board also. 

The A2B delivery team had worked on this section and have presented a good pattern for as to adopt. 

Until further research is conducted the prototype and the .net app that follows will use this adopted design. The benefits here outweight the affect of us designing a completely different view of a projects overview page.


{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Project",
      img: { src: "project.png" }
    }]
}) }}
