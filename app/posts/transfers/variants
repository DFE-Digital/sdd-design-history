### Our goal was 

To explore potential variation on Home page styles to:

* Better understand user needs
* Address issues with the current approach single vue approach
* Allow us to adapt our service quickly following user feedback

A landing page was also created to allow user research to move accross the different variants; and the whole prototype with ease.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Landing",
      img: { src: "01-landing.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Variant 1",
      img: { src: "02-variant-1.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Variant 2",
      img: { src: "03-variant-2.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Variant 3",
      img: { src: "04-variant-3.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Variant 4",
      img: { src: "05-variant-4.png" }
    }]
}) }}
