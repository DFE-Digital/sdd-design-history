## Why we have included this task in the service

![Set transfer dates](/images/transfers/set-transfer-dates/set-transfer-dates.png)

### User need
**As a** delivery officer working on Managing an academy transfer
**I need** to understand the timelines agreed for the project delivery
**So that** I can effectively manage the project to meet its deadline

## Pre-private beta user research insights
* The title could be key dates
* It is very hard to remember, the conversation started way back
* I would get rid of the date and keep just the month

## Giving an option for users to declare date unknown

Before
![When was the transfer first discussed with a trust](/images/transfers/set-transfer-dates/before.png)

After
![When was the transfer first discussed with a trust](/images/transfers/set-transfer-dates/after.png)

## Expected result

We are confident that the additional option to declare "I do not know this" will help our users to complete this task with ease. We will monitor the usage of this question and update further insights as we reach out to more users.
