### The starting point 

After several research sessions with the main user type we came to a conclusion that an amalgamation of the best features of 2 variants. Would be the best way forward. The users liked the simplicity of one of the variants and the stucture of another the result is the screenshot below.

A lot of work went on behind the scenes from our user researcher to surface the absolutely key needs for our users. The design was  stripped from elements that did not meet any of the user needs.  

Until further research is conducted the prototype and the .net app that follows will use this design.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Choosing",
      img: { src: "choosing.png" }
    }]
}) }}
