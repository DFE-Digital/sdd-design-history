# Apply to become first designs

## Apply to become overview
The end to end Apply to become an Academy service will manage the whole journey for a school converting to an academy, from the initial application through to the point at which the academy opens. In June 2020 we released the ‘Apply to become an Academy’ digital application service on GOV.UK. This project focuses on the internal service.

### Date the work was done
January 2021
## The internal service
The internal service was built using Microsoft Dynamics and had been in Private Beta for some time. Usability testing was conducted on an initial working product following the progress of several users through the process. The research concluded that there were a number of issues with the service.
Project leads [users] felt unable to use the service to produce the documents for Headteacher Board due to the problems they experienced. There is no evidence that adding more users without making changes would have led to a successful outcome.​
Some of the key navigational and workflow issues experienced during the private beta were also evidenced during alpha. The changes made before launching beta were not sufficient to overcome these problems.​

## Introduction
For this first part of the process, we were looking at converting all the user needs we had collected from the initial Alpha and Private Beta projects into a prototype. We also wanted to include our findings from our private Beta research in our new prototype and then put it in front of users.

The prototype would be used as a conversation starter with our users. It was a way of identifying holes in our knowledge and getting users to talk about some of the more mundane and complex parts of the process.

## Design
A technical investigation which was completed at the end of January by another team determined that the best approach for this service was to use the GDS design kit to create the user interface.

This is the first iteration of our ideas. The designs were created in Figma as quick way of interpreting all of findings without the technical debt of an HTML prototype.
