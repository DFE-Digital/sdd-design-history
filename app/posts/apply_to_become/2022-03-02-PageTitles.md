Web pages, like the ones used in the Apply to become an academy service, should have meaningful titles and headings. 

It's good for orientation is particularly helpful for adaptive technology users. 

'Title' tags within a page’s code can tell screen reading software what the page is called when the user highlights its tab. In turn, this can be read out to the user so that they can quickly tell which page they have selected. 

`<title>Title of the page</title>`
## The problem

The title used in the Apply to become an academy service is the same for every page. 

To make matters worse, what it says is not descriptive.

### Action required
- Each of the service's title tags should be updated so that it meaningfully describes what the page is about.
  
## Our solution
We want to be consistent with what our colleagues in the other teams have done, presenting the page name followed by the name of the service.

> ‘Name of the new trust – Apply to become an academy’.

### What we wanted to do
To begin with, we hoped that we could use a script to take the main heading from each page, combine it with the name of the service and use that to replace the existing text in the tag. 

Unfortunately, many of our current headings were not descriptive or meaningful enough to use as titles. 


### What we decided to do
Fixing all of the existing page headings would need to be done as part of bigger service redesign. So instead we chose to  manually draw up a list of temporary replacement tags for every page.

### Why we chose this approach

This approach was time consuming, but we felt it was the only option, given:

- this was an accessibility issue that needed to be resolved quickly
- any alteration to a page's heading would be a waste of time if the page is later removed or reworked as part of ongoing design changes
