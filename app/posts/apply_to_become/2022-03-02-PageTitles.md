## Description
Web pages, like the ones used in the Apply to become an academy service, should have meaningful titles and headings. They help to orientate the user and are particularly helpful for adaptive technology users. 

'Title' tags within a page’s code can tell screen reading software what the page is called when the user highlights the tab. In turn, this can be read out to the user so that they can quickly tell which page they have selected. 

`<title>Title of the page</title>`

You can see the page’s title in the browser tab's text.

## Action required
- Title tags should be updated so that they meaningfully describe what their page is about.
  
## Proposed solution
We want to be consistent with what our colleagues in the other teams have done, presenting the page name followed by the name of the service.

> ‘Name of the new trust – Apply to become an academy’.

To begin with, we hoped that we could use a script to take the main heading from each page, combine it with the name of the service and add feed it into the title tags. 

Unfortunately, many of our current headings were not descriptive or meaningful enough to use as titles. 

![Some of our headings would be unsuitable as titles.](/images/a2become/titles/further_information.jpeg "A screen grab from on of the services pages. It has a heading that reads 'Further information'.")

Fixing all of the existing page headings would need to be done as part of bigger service redesign. So instead we chose to  manually draw up a list of temporary replacement tags for every page.

## Rationale 

This approach was time consuming, but we felt it was he only option given:

- this was a current accessibility issue that needed to be resolved quickly
- any alteration to a page's heading would be a waste of time if the page is later removed or reworked as part of ongoing design changes
