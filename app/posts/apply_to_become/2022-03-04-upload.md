description: Solving usability issues in the upload component by providing notifications.

## Description

The audit found two main issues with the usability of the upload component used through the service.

-	Missing Notifications 
When users carry out an action, they expect to be told if that action was successful or not. That is not the case when users upload a document, they are not notified that the upload is successful. It is only when they move to the next page, they can see they have successfully uploaded a document.
A cognitive tester found it a little confusing to see that even though she had uploaded a file page still said no file uploaded.

-	Error prevention
To minimise errors all required information must be given to a user in text, prior to the submitting a document.  The file upload areas in this website do not inform the user of the file type required. It is only after submitting a file type that is not allowed, that the user receives a notification.

## Actions Required
-	Provide notification that an action has occurred (upload successful) 
-	Give the user file type information prior to them submitting or uploading a document

## Proposed solution

List supported file formats before the user upload the file.

> Image 3. Shows the proposed new design for this component where the file formats supported are listed above the _choose file_ button, so users are aware of any potential restrictions before they start the upload process.

- After the user chooses a file, they will be presented with the option to ***Upload the file*** or ***Continue without saving***. 
If the user clicks on the ***Upload file*** and the upload is successful, they will be presented with a successful notification banner (Notification banner â€“ GOV.UK Design System (design-system.service.gov.uk) as well as the name of the file, size and the option to delete it.
