During July 2020, Destek performed and accessibility audit for the Apply to become an academy service.

The service was evaluated against the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to conformance level AA. The audit used both automated and manual user testing evaluation tools. 

The result of the audit produced a few issues while some issues have been resolved in the past it is now the Service support team who will be addressing the rest of the issues.

The proposed solutions will be documented in this design history.
