During July 2020, Destek performed an accessibility audit for the Apply to become an academy service. 

The service was evaluated against the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 to conformance level AA. The audit used both automated and manual user testing evaluation tools and highlighted a few accessibility shortcomings. Some of the original issues were resolved by the different teams which have own the service since then. 

Recently the **TRAMS and Apply to become an academy service team** was created to continue implementing fixes to the issues that are still pending. 

The proposed accessibility solutions will be documented in this design history, along with general improvements to the user interface of the service.
