title: Accessibility issue 08 - Duplicate links 
description: Duplicate links create overload of information and confusion for people who use screen readers. 
date: 2022-03-02

## Description
Screen reader assistive technologies can accurately interpret and analyse content if it is entered correctly from the outset.  Errors such as duplicate link descriptions can cause confusion to users as they offer no context to the where the link will direct them to.
There is also an issue with the design of the page since it doesnâ€™t follow any of the GDS approved components. The current design creates an overload of information to the user since they will have to review all answers before if they want to change anything from the list.

> Image 2. Shows a preview of what a screen reader will read out to users. The multiple links do not give any indication regarding which change is being applied.

## Action Required 
- Redesign the page using the [GDS summary list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/) component 
- Use the full description of the link when coding the page
